Abstractâ€” The car price prediction project using 
machine learning is used to develop a predictive 
model that can accurately estimate best price of a 
car based on various factors such as the make and 
model of the car, its company , model of car , 
Manufacture year , fuel type and other factors. This 
project is useful for car buyers and sellers who want 
to determine a fair price for a particular vehicle. To 
predict the better result in more accurate and 
reliable the number of different attributes is 
measured and also it has to be consider to predict the 
best result. There are Different machine learning 
algorithms will be used for model selection, 
including linear regression, logistic regression , and 
random forests. The performance of each Machine 
Learning model will be calculated using metrics 
such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, 
and R-squared. The final model will be selected 
based on its performance and will be used to predict 
the best price of new cars. The accuracy of the model 
will be tested using a test dataset that was not used 
in the training process . Overall, the car price 
prediction project using machine learning will 
provide a useful tool for car buyers and sellers to 
determine a fair price for a car based on its features 
and condition
